		Denny married Richard Harington, who had the title of the 12th Baronet Harington, a title that has existed since the 1400s. “My parents didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up,” 
		Harrington told the London Evening Standard newspaper. “We were comfortable, but I didn’t go to Oxbridge, and yet every American interviewer I get says to me, ‘You’re related to Charles II! Your grandfather was a baronet!’”

    <h3 align="center"><i>Christopher Guest and Jamie Lee Curtis</i></h3>
		Okay, this one's a doozy. The man behind This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, A Might Wind, and For Your Consideration and his superstar actress wife are Hollywood legends, 
		but did you know that Guest not only holds duel-citizenship in England and the US, but is also a member of British nobility? Guest's formal title is 5th Baron Haden-Guest, 
		and at one point, his family had a seat in the House of Lords. That means Jamie Lee Curtis's full name is Jamie Lee Haden-Guest, Baroness Haden-Guest, and she is a baroness herself. 
		Note: while Guest is on this list of royalty, technically, he's not actually royalty, but part of the peerage. To be considered royalty, you must be related to the royal family somehow, 
		while peers are people who've had noble title bestowed upon them by royalty, but aren't royal themselves. To make it simple, Downton Abbey is about the peerage, The Crown is about royalty.

    <h3 align="center"><i>Benedict Cumberbatch</i></h3>
		A legendary actor in his own right, it's no surprise he comes from a royal lineage. Cumberbatch is a descendant of King Richard III of England. 
		Cumberbatch played his ancestor in a series for the BBC, and read a poem at the reburial of Richard III in Leicester Cathedral in 2015.

    <h3 align="center"><i>Tom Hanks</i></h3>

    <h3 align="center"><i>Alec Baldwin</i></h3>
		The actor is a descendant of Æthelred the Unready, who was the King of England from 978 until his death in 1016, which also makes Baldwin Queen Elizabeth's 29th cousin, twice removed.

    <h3 align="center"><i>Richard Gere</i></h3>
		Richard Gere is more than just Hollywood royalty–he's also got a good deal of royal blood in him. The New York native is related to Queen Elizabeth as her 22nd cousin, twice removed, through Edward I.
